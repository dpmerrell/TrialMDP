Title: An Algorithm for Designing Adaptive Multistage Clinical Trials

Description: TrialMDP models an adaptive multistage trial as a Markov Decision Process, and solves it via dynamic programming.
             It saves the trial design (i.e., optimal policy) as a SQLite database.
             TrialMDP allows the user to specify a balance between (i) statistical power and (ii) patient outcomes.
